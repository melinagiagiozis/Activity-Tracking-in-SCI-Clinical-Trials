üìù Abstract: 

Background: The aim of clinical trials for spinal cord injury (SCI) is to improve everyday-life activity outcomes, which requires reliable methods for monitoring patient activity. This study evaluates sensor-derived activity metrics in comparison to established clinical assessment methods.

Methods: Wearable inertial sensors collected data from 69 individuals with acute traumatic cervical SCI participating in the Nogo-A Inhibition in Spinal Cord Injury (NISCI) trial ([NCT03935321](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03935321)), a phase 2b multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. During inpatient rehabilitation, participants wore up to five inertial sensors for up to three consecutive days each week. An estimation of average daily energy expenditure (EE) was used as an indicator of physical activity and compared to the recovery of upper extremity motor scores (UEMS) and spinal cord independence measures (SCIM).

Results: Participants in the _verum_ (n = 41; 59.4%) and placebo (n = 28; 40.6%) groups showed similar initial activity levels, however, the _verum_ group exhibited a significantly greater weekly increase in average daily EE (delta EE = 11.6 kcal/d per week, 95% CI [1.5, 21.8], p = 0.025). In contrast, no significant group differences were observed in changes in UEMS (delta UEMS = 0.1 per week, 95% CI [‚Äì0.2, 0.3], p = 0.603) or SCIM (delta SCIM = 0.2, per week 95% CI [-0.7, 1.1], p = 0.644).

Conclusion: Continuous sensor-based activity monitoring offers objective and sensitive insights into changes in physical capabilities, effectively complementing periodic clinical assessments. Thus, sensors-derived outcome measures offer potential for improving the evaluation of clinical studies in individuals with SCI.
